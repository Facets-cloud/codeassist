all_agents.py: This file is responsible for managing and coordinating actions across
  different agents in the system. It likely provides abstractions to initialize, control,
  and communicate with various agents, ensuring they work together smoothly.
app2.log: This log file captures runtime information and system outputs for monitoring
  and debugging purposes.
context.yml: This file stores contextual information about various files in the codebase.
  It is used to help developers understand the purpose and functionality of each file
  by providing concise descriptions, which can assist in both development and collaborative
  environments.
project_context.txt: This file stores context information for the project, helping
  developers understand the purpose and functionality of the project, specifically
  focusing on the development of an AI agent to write code. It references the swarm
  project located at https://github.com/openai/swarm.git.
run.py: This file serves as the main entry point for executing the application. It
  coordinates the initialization and execution of various components required by the
  app.
server.py: The server.py file sets up a Flask web server to handle chat-related HTTP
  API endpoints. It interfaces with a MongoDB database to store and retrieve chat
  messages. Key functionalities include starting new chat sessions, handling ongoing
  chat communications, and retrieving chat history with pagination. It uses Flask
  for the web framework and PyMongo for MongoDB interactions. UUID is used for unique
  chat thread identification, and the server leverages environment variables to configure
  database connections. The implementation provides a stub for agent responses, suggesting
  areas for further development.
tools/code_assistant.py: This module provides functionalities and supportive methods
  for coding assistance. It is used to enhance development workflows and interactions.
tools/context_assistant.py: The Context Assistant class in this file is responsible
  for managing and updating contextual information for the project's codebase. It
  reads from and writes to the context.yml to store and retrieve context details,
  aiding developers in understanding the code structure and purpose.
tools/git_assistant.py: This module contains functionalities to assist with Git operations,
  aiming to simplify version control tasks and interactions with the Git system.
tools/triage_assistant.py: This file houses the Triage Assistant class, which determines
  and directs tasks to the appropriate agent (Coding, Git, or Context Assistant) based
  on the nature of the task. It helps manage workflow efficiently by invoking the
  right assistant for specific tasks.
