all_agents.py: 'The `all_agents.py` file defines three primary agents: Triage Agent,
  Coding Assistant Agent, and Git Assistant Agent. Each agent is responsible for specific
  tasks within the system:


  1. **Triage Agent**: Manages the overall workflow by determining the appropriate
  agent for handling different user requests. It prompts the user to configure the
  base path for the assistants as a first step.


  2. **Coding Assistant Agent**: Focuses on tasks related to code management, including
  reading and updating context in files, searching codebase, and other coding activities.
  If a Git-related task arises, it refers the task to the Git Assistant.


  3. **Git Assistant Agent**: Handles Git operations like checking status, staging,
  committing, and pushing changes. For non-Git-related operations, it redirects to
  the Triage agent.


  The file also contains functions to transfer control between these agents as needed.'
context.yml: This file stores contextual information about various files in the codebase.
  It is used to help developers understand the purpose and functionality of each file
  by providing concise descriptions, which can assist in both development and collaborative
  environments.
run.py: The `run.py` file initializes and runs a command line interface for the Swarm
  application. It sets up logging to record messages in a log file (`app.log`), defines
  functions to process and print streaming responses, and manages the interaction
  loop with the user. The primary function, `run_demo_loop`, executes the simulated
  client-server communication using a given starting agent, handling user input and
  agent responses until the application exits. It defaults to using a `triage_agent`
  as the starting agent when run as a standalone script.
tools/context_assistant.py: This file contains the Context Assistant class, which
  is responsible for managing and updating context related to files in the codebase.
  It operates primarily on reading and modifying the `context.yml` where file contexts
  are stored.
tools/git_assistant.py: This file includes the Git Assistant class, which provides
  functionalities for interacting with Git operations such as commit, push, and pull.
  It's designed to assist in version control tasks conveniently from within the codebase.
