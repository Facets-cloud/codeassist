all_agents.py: 'The `all_agents.py` file defines three primary agents: Triage Agent,
  Coding Assistant Agent, and Git Assistant Agent. Each agent is responsible for specific
  tasks within the system:


  1. **Triage Agent**: Manages the overall workflow by determining the appropriate
  agent for handling different user requests. It prompts the user to configure the
  base path for the assistants as a first step.


  2. **Coding Assistant Agent**: Focuses on tasks related to code management, including
  reading and updating context in files, searching codebase, and other coding activities.
  If a Git-related task arises, it refers the task to the Git Assistant.


  3. **Git Assistant Agent**: Handles Git operations like checking status, staging,
  committing, and pushing changes. For non-Git-related operations, it redirects to
  the Triage agent.


  The file also contains functions to transfer control between these agents as needed.'
context.yml: This file stores contextual information about various files in the codebase.
  It is used to help developers understand the purpose and functionality of each file
  by providing concise descriptions, which can assist in both development and collaborative
  environments.
project_context.txt: This file stores context information for the project, helping
  developers understand the purpose and functionality of the project, specifically
  focusing on the development of an AI agent to write code. It references the swarm
  project located at https://github.com/openai/swarm.git.
run.py: The `run.py` file initializes and runs a command line interface for the Swarm
  application. It sets up logging to record messages in a log file (`app.log`), defines
  functions to process and print streaming responses, and manages the interaction
  loop with the user. The primary function, `run_demo_loop`, executes the simulated
  client-server communication using a given starting agent, handling user input and
  agent responses until the application exits. It defaults to using a `triage_agent`
  as the starting agent when run as a standalone script.
tools/code_assistant.py: This file contains the Code Assistant class, which provides
  functionalities for assisting with code management tasks such as editing and reviewing
  code, generating documentation, and understanding code context. It aims to facilitate
  coding workflows and improve productivity for developers.
tools/context_assistant.py: The Context Assistant class in this file is responsible
  for managing and updating contextual information for the project's codebase. It
  reads from and writes to the context.yml to store and retrieve context details,
  aiding developers in understanding the code structure and purpose.
tools/git_assistant.py: The Git Assistant class, defined in this file, manages git-related
  operations such as staging changes, committing, pushing, and other version control
  tasks. It provides an interface for seamless integration of git functionalities
  into the development workflow.
tools/triage_assistant.py: This file houses the Triage Assistant class, which determines
  and directs tasks to the appropriate agent (Coding, Git, or Context Assistant) based
  on the nature of the task. It helps manage workflow efficiently by invoking the
  right assistant for specific tasks.
