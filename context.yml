all_agents.py: 'The `all_agents.py` file defines three primary agents: Triage Agent,
  Coding Assistant Agent, and Git Assistant Agent. Each agent is responsible for specific
  tasks within the system:


  1. **Triage Agent**: Manages the overall workflow by determining the appropriate
  agent for handling different user requests. It prompts the user to configure the
  base path for the assistants as a first step.


  2. **Coding Assistant Agent**: Focuses on tasks related to code management, including
  reading and updating context in files, searching codebase, and other coding activities.
  If a Git-related task arises, it refers the task to the Git Assistant.


  3. **Git Assistant Agent**: Handles Git operations like checking status, staging,
  committing, and pushing changes. For non-Git-related operations, it redirects to
  the Triage agent.


  The file also contains functions to transfer control between these agents as needed.'
tools/git_assistant.py: The `git_assistant.py` file includes a `GitAssistant` class
  that provides methods for executing common Git commands like status, diff, commit,
  add, and push. It uses Python's logging module instead of print statements to log
  information, errors, and operation results. Each git operation is executed within
  the specified base path using the subprocess module. The `update_requirements` method
  updates the `requirements.txt` to ensure needed packages are listed, though it appears
  no new external requirements are added at the moment.
